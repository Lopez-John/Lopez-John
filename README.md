## Hi there, I'm John and welcome to my GitHub page!


Do you need an employee with the analytical skills to wrangle your data? Someone with the communication skills to wrangle your stakeholders? How about someone who is coming from a customer service background and is transitioning to a new career in Data Science? Imagine me solving your company's problems who have the grit needed to learn and utilize analytical, predictive, and machine learning skills. Would you like to know more?

I am currently enrolled in Bloomtech for their Data Science course. Since then, I have created a number of projects, utilizing the new technical skills I have learned

* Analyzed movie ratings on various streaming services such as Hulu and Netflix, using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and sciPy.

* Utilizing a user's Untappd data to build a classification model to determine if said user would leave a score greater than 4 or not.

* Worked as a data engineer with 4 others to build an app that returns the probability of success for a given Kickstarter.

So why did I take the leap to Data Science?

Working in Customer Service, I made an impact in the lives of the customers I interacted with, but I also wanted to be in the room where decisions are made that impact the business as a whole. I want to influence those decisions that affect the direction that company takes. After researching, I saw how data has been utilized in all industries and I wanted to learn how to manipulate that data for business needs. Whether is analyzing data, creating predictive models, or building neural networks used in software, I knew I needed to enter this new and emerging career path.
